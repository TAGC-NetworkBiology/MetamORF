## GENE_LISTS
#  ----------
# This section contains the paths to the gene lists and cross-references that need to be
# parsed and for which data need to be inserted in the database.
# For a given list, provide the name of the list and the absolute path to its file.
# The name of the list has to be the same as the name of one file parser.

## GENE_LIST_ORDER_OF_INSERTION
#  ----------------------------
# This section has to be provided if the gene lists need to be parsed and inserted in a specific order.
# List names have to be separated with a comma and using the same name as in the "DATASOURCE" section.
# This section does not need to be provided if there is one single list use for cross-references.

## DATASOURCE
#  ----------
# This section contains the paths to the files that need to be parsed and for which data 
# need to be inserted in the database.
# For a given source, provide the name of the source and the absolute path to its file.
# The name of the source has to be the same as the name of one file parser.

## DATA_ORDER_OF_INSERTION
#  -----------------------
# This section has to be provided if the raw data need to be parsed and inserted in a specific order.
# Sources have to be separated with a comma and using the same name as in the "DATASOURCE" section. 
# The program will first treat the sources provided in this list in the appropriate order and then
# parse and insert data from the other sources if all of them are not present in this list.
# Usually this section does not need to be provided.
